## The Basics

<br>

### Introduction
The simplified main job of a web developer is to create websites. They ensure that websites are up-to-date, easy to navigate and are visually appealing. However, the job of a webdevelop is not an easy task and requires years of experience and knowledge. Web developers are typically split into three categories:

1. Front-end Developers
    -  Writes code that defines the visual aspect of the website and what the user sees
    - They form the style and other body elements of the website
2. Back-end Developers
    - Creates the websites structure
    - Codes and develops the websiteâ€™s databases and servers to ensure the website can run smoothly
3. Full-stack Developers
    - These developers incorporate the jobs of both front end and back end developers into their work

### Required Skills
#### Technical Skills:
The main technical skill needed for web developing is the ability to code in multiple programming languages. Although the specific coding languages needed is dependant on the job, there are a few languages that are commonly used and should be learned.
1. HTML
    * Provides structure
    * Form the fundamental rules of the web page including formatting and other element types
2. PHP
    * Server side language

    * Main use is to determine the sites response to user input
3. CSS
    * Layout and appearance of elements on the site
    * Font, colors, spacing, sizes
4. Javascript
    * Elements response to user clicks and making the site interactive
