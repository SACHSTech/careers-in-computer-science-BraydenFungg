## The Basics

<br>

### Introduction
The simplified main job of a web developer is to create websites. They ensure that websites are up-to-date, easy to navigate and are visually appealing. However, the job of a webdevelop is not an easy task and requires years of experience and knowledge. Web developers are typically split into three categories:

1. Front-end Developers
    -  Writes code that defines the visual aspect of the website and what the user sees
    - They form the style and other body elements of the website
2. Back-end Developers
    - Creates the websites structure
    - Codes and develops the website’s databases and servers to ensure the website can run smoothly
3. Full-stack Developers
    - These developers incorporate the jobs of both front end and back end developers into their work

<br>

### Required Skills
#### Technical Skills:
The main technical skill needed for web developing is the ability to code in multiple programming languages. Although the specific coding languages needed is dependant on the job, there are a few languages that are commonly used and should be learned.
1. HTML
    * Provides structure
    * Form the fundamental rules of the web page including formatting and other element types
2. PHP
    * Server side language
    * Key to backend development
    * Main use is to determine the sites response to user input
3. CSS
    * Layout and appearance of elements on the site
    * Font, colors, spacing, sizes
4. Javascript
    * Elements response to user clicks and making the site interactive

#### Non-Technical Skills:
Additionally, there are non-technical skills that are needed not specifically just for the job as a web developer, but for any job that you might get. Some of these non-technical skills include interpersonal communication, creativity, and attention to detail.

<br>

### Salary
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the median average salary was $69,430 as of 2018 with a projected job growth rate of 13% from 2018 to 2028. However, the job salary depends on experience and the amount of years spent as a web developer.
* As an entry level webdeveloper, the median salary is around $50,089
* As an early career level web developer (1-4 years), the median salary is around $56,195
* As a mid career level web developer (5-9), the median salary is around $65,909
* As an experienced web developer (10-19), the median salary is around $70,447

<br>

### Qualifications
The good news about being a web developer is that degrees, certifications, and diplomas are not necessary to join the work force. As long as you have the right skills, there is nothing stopping you from showcasing your work and getting into the field of web development. Although not required, there are multiple university and college level degrees that have programs that can give you the knowledge required to excel in the web development job field. More information will be provided below.

## Standard Education
Although getting a degree, diploma, or certificate is not necessary to get into the web development job field, there are still many universities and colleges that offer programs that will help you hone your coding skills. One of the many schools is CDI College, a canadian college that has many campuses located in Ontario.

This web development program takes place on campus, takes around 42 weeks to complete, and successful graduates will recieve a diploma. To apply, you must either have a high school diploma or be a mature student and pass the entrance exam. There are no academic average requirements or any course prerequisites.

<br>

### Potential Year One Programs

1. Programming Logic and Design
    - Provide students with an understand of programming principles and methodologies to foster the development of programing techniques
    - Master terminology and logic behind how code works without focusing on the programing langue itself
2. Object Oriented programming
    - Fundamental concepts and techniques of object-oriented programming using java
    - Understand control structures, class libraries, methods and the application of OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism
3. Adobe Photoshop
    - Understand key elements of the photoshop interface and how to transform images using a variety of tools, effets, and filters.

## Experimental Learning

As a degrees, diplomas, and certifications are not necessary to start a career in web development, creating a portfolio or a collection of your work is necessary to showcase your work and to future employers what you are capable of. 

<br>

Furthermore, projects and other opportunities that allow you to practice and build up your website creating skills are necessary to gain valuable skills that future jobs might need.

<br>

Self starting projects or even creating websites for friends and relatives is good practice to ensure that you would excel at future jobs.

<br>

Similarly, non technical skills also need to be developed to ensure that you excel at this job. A very important non-technical skill that will help you excel in this field is your artistic creativity.

<br>

Using applications such as photoshop or website-creating apps like wix and squarespace can help you understand what you want your websites to look like without having to put in work into actual code.

<br>

They can challenge you to think outside of the box and try to think of new unique ways to grab a clients attention
Additionally, online coding tutors and courses are widely available for you to practice and hone your web developing skills. They come at a significantly less cost than a university and college degree but can still help you improve your coding skills and get you more comfortable with the many programming languages.
